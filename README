Magellan is a lightweight search engine with a built-in spider.

Dependencies (handled via setup.py):

Django, probably >= 1.2.
Whoosh.
Spider makes use of httplib2 and BeautifulSoup.
Chardet is not required but will improve results greatly.

Some parts of spider were extracted from the django-spider project, forked from https://github.com/coleifer/django-spider.

Installation:
1. Create your search engine project in django.
2. Install magellan via your favorite package installer.
3. Add 'magellan' to your INSTALLED_APPS.  If you are not overriding the search_results.html template, also add 'pagination' to INSTALLED_APPS and 'pagination.middleware.PaginationMiddleware' to MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES.

4. Configure your database (sqlite will work fine, if desired.)
5. In settings.py, configure:
    MAGELLAN_PLUGINS_MODULE_PATH = "searchengine.plugins" 
    - Optional, if you want to provide site-specific content extractors.
    MAGELLAN_WHOOSH_INDEX = os.path.join(my_path, 'whoosh_site_index')
    - Where to store the Whoosh files.
    MAGELLAN_WHOOSH_MAX_MEMORY = 256 #memory to limit the whoosh indexer to use while spidering.  bigger = faster
    - Maximum memory to use for Whoosh.  Bigger is better.
    SPIDER_COOKIE_JAR = os.path.join(my_path, 'cookies')
    - Where to store auth cookies when spidering. 
6. Run your django server (manage.py runserver or however you deploy this)
7. In django's admin, configure one or more SearchProfile objects.
8. Invoke the spider via manage.py index (which can take the name of a profile as an argument)
9. Hook up the magellan search result view in your urls.py. (This will become an include eventually.)
         url(r'^search/', 'magellan.views.search'),
