Magellan is a lightweight search engine with a built-in spider.

For more info, see /docs or http://readthedocs.org/docs/django-magellan/en/latest/.

Dependencies (handled via setup.py):

Django, probably >= 1.2.
Whoosh.
Spider makes use of httplib2 and BeautifulSoup.
Chardet is not required but will improve results greatly.

Some parts of spider were extracted from the django-spider project, forked from https://github.com/coleifer/django-spider.
